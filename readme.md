# Redyeable

Redyeable is a Minecraft Fabric mod that makes dyeing blocks like glass and terracotta easier. Blocks can be dyed infinitely and individually, like wool, instead of only once and in groups of eight.

***Supported Versions:** 1.21.7, 1.21.8, 1.21.9, 1.21.10, 1.21.11*
***
## Supported Blocks
- Banners
- Candles
- Carpet
- Concrete
- Concrete Powder
- Glass
- Glass Panes
- Glazed Terracotta
- Terracotta
- Wool

Wool and carpet could already be dyed without restriction. With Redyeable, they can now also be dyed in groups of eight, like terracotta and glass.

***

As of v1.2.0, Redyeable also adds several new dye combination recipes for convenience.

Redyeable will work just fine on singleplayer, but will not work in multiplayer if the server does not have it installed.

*This is my first time developing a mod, so any feedback or suggestions would be very appreciated!*
